    <h3 style="position: relative ;text-align: center;">HTML</h3>
    <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard[dubious – discuss] markup language[a] for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
    <br><br>
    Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.
   <br><br>
   HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as  and 
   directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as

                                                                   and
   <br><br>
   surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page. In 1980, the physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[4] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.[5]
   <br><br>
   The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags",[6] first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.[7][8] It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by CERN SGML, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.[9

    <h1 style="position: relative;text-align: center;">CSS</h1>
    <p><big>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[2] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[3]
    <br><br>
CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[4] This separation can improve content accessibility, since the content can be written without concern for its presentation; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternative formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[5]
    <br><br>
The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which declaration applies if more than one declaration of a property match a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.
    <br><br>
The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.[6]</p></big>

 <section id="Angular">
     <h1 style="position: relative;text-align: center;">Angular</h1><big>
     <p>Angular (also referred to as Angular 2+) is a TypeScript-based free and open-source single-page web application framework. It is developed by Google and by a community of individuals and corporations. Angular is a complete rewrite from the same team that built AngularJS. The Angular ecosystem consists of a diverse group of over 1.7 million developers, library authors, and content creators. According to the Stack Overflow Developer Survey, Angular is one of the most commonly used web frameworks.Angular uses a component-based architecture, which allows developers to build encapsulated, reusable user interface elements. Each component encapsulates its own HTML, CSS, and TypeScript, making it easier to manage and test individual pieces of an application.Angular 2.0 was announced during the keynote of the 2014 NG-Conf conference 16–17 January 2014.[16] On April 30, 2015, the Angular developers announced that Angular 2 moved from Alpha to Developer Preview. Angular 2 moved to Beta in December 2015, and the first release candidate was published in May 2016. The final version was released on 14 September 2016.
     <br><br>
Version 8 of Angular introduced a new compilation and rendering pipeline, Ivy, and version 9 of Angular enabled Ivy by default. Angular 13 removed the deprecated former compiler, View Engine.[20] Angular 14 introduced standalone components and Angular 17 made them the default, de-emphasizing the use of modules.
     <br><br>
Angular 18, released in 2024, introduced several improvements such as standalone components defaulting to true, built-in control flow syntax, zoneless support previews, and modern SSR debugging tools.
     <br><br>
Naming
The rewrite of AngularJS was called "Angular 2", but this led to confusion among developers. To clarify, the team announced that separate names should be used for each framework with "AngularJS" referring to the 1.X versions and "Angular" without the "JS" referring to versions 2 and up.</p></big>

 <section id="js">
      <h1 style="position: relative;text-align: center;">JavaSkript</h1>
      <p><big>JavaScript (JS)[a] is a programming language and core technology of the Web, alongside HTML and CSS. It was created by Brendan Eich in 1995.[6] As of 2025, the overwhelming majority of websites (98.9%) uses JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior.[10]
<br><br>
Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code. These engines are also utilized in some servers and a variety of apps. The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is Node.js.[11]
<br><br>
JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time–compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[12] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
<br><br>
The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
<br><br>
Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name and syntax, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.</p></big>

    <h1 style="position: relative;text-align: center;">Google</h1>
    <p><big>Google LLC (/ˈɡuː.ɡəl/ ⓘ, GOO-gəl) is an American multinational technology corporation focused on information technology, online advertising, search engine technology, email, cloud computing, software, quantum computing, e-commerce, consumer electronics, and artificial intelligence (AI).[9] It has been referred to as "the most powerful company in the world" by BBC,[10] and is one of the world's most valuable brands.[11][12][13] Google's parent company Alphabet Inc. has been described as a Big Tech company.
   <br><br>
Google was founded on September 4, 1998, by American computer scientists Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Together, they own about 14% of its publicly listed shares and control 56% of its stockholder voting power through super-voting stock. The company went public via an initial public offering (IPO) in 2004. In 2015, Google was reorganized as a wholly owned subsidiary of Alphabet Inc.
<br><br> Google is Alphabet's largest subsidiary and is a holding company for Alphabet's internet properties and interests. Sundar Pichai was appointed CEO of Google on October 24, 2015, replacing Larry Page, who became the CEO of Alphabet. On December 3, 2019, Pichai also became the CEO of Alphabet.[14]

 <h1 style="position: relative;text-align: center;">Apple</h1>
 <p><big> Apple Inc. is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Cupertino, California, in Silicon Valley, best known for its consumer electronics, software and online services. Founded in 1976 as Apple Computer Company by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne, the company was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. the following year. It was renamed to its current name in 2007 as the company had expanded its focus from computers to consumer electronics. Apple has been described as a Big Tech company.
<br><br>
The company was founded to market Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Its successor, the Apple II, became one of the first successful mass-produced microcomputers. Apple introduced the Lisa in 1983 and the Macintosh in 1984 as some of the first computers to use a graphical user interface and a mouse.
<br><br> By 1985, internal conflicts led to Jobs leaving the company to form NeXT and Wozniak withdrawing to other ventures; John Sculley served as CEO for over a decade. In the 1990s, Apple lost considerable market share in the personal computer industry to the lower-priced Wintel duopoly of Intel-powered PC clones running Microsoft Windows, and neared bankruptcy by 1997.
<br><br> To overhaul its market strategy, it acquired NeXT, bringing Jobs back to the company. Under his leadership, Apple returned to profitability by introducing the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad devices; creating the iTunes Store; launching the "Think different" advertising campaign; and opening the Apple Store retail chain. Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons, and died two months later; he was succeeded as CEO by Tim Cook.</p></big>
